# Create-Copy-Delete-Folder-APIs
This repository contains APIs used to create a folder, recursively copy a folder and recursively delete a folder. Also includes an example console application.

The implementation is based on std::wstring and WCHAR which are used to access and create files with unicode characters.

Tested only on Windows 10.
